# About
- This is a small project in rust, that I wrote to practice the language. It's not finished, also needs some polishing, which I will be doing after I'm finished with my exams.

# Functions
-The game can be played on any sized map that the player decides (right now it only works for odd numbered dimensions).

# Run
- To run the game we simply have to type the following command into the terminal, with rust installed:
```
cargo run
```
